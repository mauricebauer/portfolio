However, my career only really began with my first full-time job, the corporate university studies with an industrial company.\nMini-job in my parents’ company (2015-Today)\nSince I started early to support my parents in their service business, the opportunity arose to earn a little extra pocket money. This first work experience combined different aspects of a job profile for me. First of all, I had the opportunity to plan and also program solutions for intelligent smart-home automation in direct customer contact. In addition, I was able to live out my passion for computer technology early on by installing the internal IT infrastructure and maintaining it to this day. Of course, subsequent user support also plays an important role in adapting an IT infrastructure. This infrastructure includes servers, clients and network technology. Internship and vacation-job in an industrial company (2017)\nI made my first professional programming experience during my internship at an industrial company with a focus on measurement, control and regulation technology. Here I learned the programming language C#, with which I programmed an application to control an Arduino using its serial interface.\nI worked on the vacation job between my high-school graduation and the beginning of my university studies. Among other things, I developed desktop applications with C# and WPF, but also embedded-software with C++ for the computer and for 32-bit microcontrollers. Corporate university studies: B.Sc. Applied Computer Science (2017-2020)\nIn the same industrial company, I was now able to complete my bachelor’s degree in cooperation with the Corporate State University in Baden-Württemberg (DE). The dual study program combines theory with practice, allowing the acquired knowledge to be applied each time I alternated between theory and practical phases. Contents of the computer science studies included: theoretical computer science, software engineering, IT security, web-engineering, project management, … The gained knowledge was applied in various software projects, such as the development of a simulation software, the integration of Google Analytics or the planning and implementation of a remote maintenance solution. The final part of my university studies was my bachelor thesis with the title “Development of a cloud-based service solution for field devices”. Development engineer (2020-2021)\nAfter completing my bachelor’s degree, I worked as a development engineer on full-stack solutions (using Angular and Node.js) but I also continued maintaining existing software in the .NET environment using C# and WPF. Master program: M.Sc. Applied Computer Science (2021-Today)\nThe master’s program at the University of Applied Sciences in Esslingen now represents an extension to my bachelor’s degree. Here, I take the opportunity to theoretically deepen the contents of the bachelor’s degree and the experiences from the professional development activities and to implement them in practice-oriented research projects. The focus of the studies is on artificial intelligence, software engineering and IT security.
